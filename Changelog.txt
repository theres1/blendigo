3.6.11.0
--------
* Fixed issue with object in edit mode not being exported.
* write_igmesh() now always writes at least one UV (to stop Indigo from complaining about meshes without UVs using textures).
* Added Absorption channel to coating material.
* Exposure is now a float value to allow exposure > 1s (unfortunately resets exposure back to 125 in exising scenes).

3.6.10.0
--------
* Added Transmittance channel to double-sided thin material.
* Hemi lamp now supports both Spherical and Spherical Environment types.
